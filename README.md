# JxInsta

## Implimentation
Due to the outage of jitpack, the library cannot published. Therfore, you have to locally implement it by puting the .jar file in the lib directory.

#### Step 1 : Download the `.jar` from the release section and put it in `lib` folder of your project.

#### Step 2 : declare the dependency
*For gradle*

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation files('libs/JxInsta-v1.0-beta.jar')
    implementation group: 'com.squareup.okhttp3', name: 'okhttp', version: '5.0.0-alpha.11' //skip if already implemented
}
```

*For maven*

```XML
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.sample</groupId>
    <artifactId>jxinsta</artifactId>
    <version>v1.0-beta-2</version>
    <scope>system</scope>
    <systemPath>${project.basedir}/lib/JxInsta-v1.0-beta-2.jar</systemPath>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.squareup.okhttp3</groupId>
    <artifactId>okhttp</artifactId>
    <version>5.0.0-alpha.11</version>
</dependency>

```

You can search on Google for more info on including local dependencies.

## FAQ

#### [Q.1] Can we use this library to make bots?

**Answer.** Yes. But Instagram doesn't allow them to make bots with their official graph APIs. Although this is not the official API, you should follow the usage limits to prevent detection.

#### [Q.2] Can we download stories or posts using this library?

**Answer.** Yes, and that too without login

#### [Q.3] Does the use of this library require any tokens or other keys?

**Answer.** No. You only need to have the username and password of the account. You can also log in using cookies and bearer tokens.

#### [Q.4] In Android, can we use Webview to log in?

**Answer.**  Yes, check  [this](https://github.com/ErrorxCode/JxInsta/wiki/Android-users#using-webview-for-login)  example on how to use that
