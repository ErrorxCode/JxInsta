## FAQ

#### [Q.1] Can we use this library to make bots?

**Answer.** Yes. But Instagram doesn't allow them to make bots with their official graph APIs. Although this is not the official API, you should follow the usage limits to prevent detection.

#### [Q.2] Can we download stories or posts using this library?

**Answer.** Yes, and that too without login

#### [Q.3] Does the use of this library require any tokens or other keys?

**Answer.** No. You only need to have the username and password of the account. You can also log in using cookies and bearer tokens.

#### [Q.4] In Android, can we use Webview to log in?

**Answer.**  Yes, check  [this](https://github.com/ErrorxCode/JxInsta/wiki/Android-users#using-webview-for-login)  example on how to use that
